This project explores fundamental Excel functions, providing a foundation for users to efficiently manage and analyze data. The project focuses on teaching key functions within Excel that help simplify data organization, calculations, and data visualization. Core functions covered include SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, and IF, as well as sorting, filtering, and basic formatting techniques. By understanding these essential functions, users will gain practical skills applicable to various fields, enhancing productivity and accuracy in data management tasks. The project is designed for beginners and provides step-by-step guidance for each function, with practical examples and applications.
### Data source
The primary source of data used here is Employee staff record.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle.com or Data.com.
### Tools Used
- Microsoft excel
   1. For creating,
   2. For testing
   3. For demostrating Excel functions
- Github for portfolio building

- ### Data creating
   1. Define the purpose of Data
   2. Choose data columns
   3. Generate sample Data for Each Column
   4. Format the data
 
### Data Testing
- Test the Data with Basis Excel Functions

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involved testing some basic excel functions in answering some questions about the data such as:
 - Grand Total
-  Average salary
 -  Highest salary
 - Lowest salary
- Total no of Staff
- Fourth highest slary
- Third lowest salary


### Data Analysis
This is where we include basis excel functions used for our expressions during analysis
- =SUM(C3:C22)
- =AVERAGE(C3:C22)
- =MAX(C3:C22)
- =MIN(C3:C22)
- =COUNTA(A3:A22)
- =LARGE(C3:C22,4)
- =SMALL(C3:C22,3)
